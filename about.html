				<b>ABOUT BALIYATRA:-</b><hr>
				Bāli Jātrā, (Odia: ବାଲିଯାତ୍ରା, lit. 'Voyage to Bali') pronounced [bali dʒat̪ɾa], is the major Boita Bandana festival held at Cuttack on Kartik Purnima.
				It is considered to be one of Asia's largest open trade fair. The festival is held in Odisha (a state in eastern India), in the city of Cuttack 
				at Gadagadia Ghata of the Mahanadi river, to mark the day when ancient Sadhabas (Odia mariners) would set sail to distant lands of Bali,
				as well as Java (at the time of the voyage known as "Yawadvipa"), Sumatra, Borneo (all in Indonesia), and Sri Lanka (formerly Ceylon) for trade and cultural expansion. 
				To commemorate this, the festival is celebrated every year from the day of Kartika Purnima (full moon day of the month of Kartika) according to the Odia calendar
				<br><br>
				<b>OVERVIEW:-</b><hr>
				On Kartika Purnima, which comes around the end of October and November, people of Odisha gather near banks of Mahanadi, Brahmani river, other river banks, ponds, 
				water tanks and sea shores to float miniature toy boats, made of colored paper, dried banana tree barks, and cork, as a symbolic gesture of their ancestors' voyage.
				These toy boats, usually launched early in the morning contain traditional paan and small oil lamps, which are lit and placed inside them, to provide an attractive
				sight during the festival. People sing a song Aa ka ma boi, pan gua thoi... to remember the early maritime history of Odisha. The song tells about four months that 
				are important for marine merchants of Kalinga (the earlier name of Odisha). This festival is also celebrated with great fanfare in Paradeep. Bali Jatra bears
				testimony to the rich maritime legacy of ancient Odisha. This is the specific time that was considered auspicious by the Sadhabas to begin their voyage in vessels called Boitas.
				The voyage is begun on Kartika Purnima to take advantage of the favorable wind blowing during this time. Ajhala or big fabric sails were used to harness the wind power to move the Boitas.

				Bali Jatra is also associated with Ta'apoi and rituals like Bhalukuni Osha or Khudurukuni Osha and Bada Osha. Ta'apoi is closely associated with the Bali Jatra 
				festival, which recalls traditional memories of young maidens waiting for the return of their sailor brothers.<br><br>
				<b>CUTTACK:-</b><hr>
				In Cuttack, Bali Jatra is celebrated annually as a large open fair near the Barabati Fort area. There are several attractions for children like toy stalls, 
				giant wheels, different games, maut ka kuan (literally well of death) and food stalls selling Odia delicacies (Cuttack Dahibara Aludum, Thunka puri, Kulfi,
				Gupchup, Mathura Cake, Banarasi Paan etc.) from different parts of the state, and other vendors selling toys, curiosities, and other gifts. Bali Jatra also
				witnesses a lot of cultural programs. Every year millions of people from all around the world visit Bali Jatra to experience it.<br><br>
				<b>Other BaliYatras:-</b><hr>
				Apart from the major Bali Jatra held at Cuttack, other Bali Jatras are also held across the state. Some notable ones held are Kalinga Bali Jatra held at Paradeep,
				Chelitola Bali Jatra at Tirtol.The prominent Bali Jatra after Cuttack is the Kalinga Bali Jatra held at Paradeep since 1992. It was inaugurated by the then 
				Chief Minister Biju Patnaik by flagging off the naval yacht INSV Samudra, which reached the port Benoa Harbour, Denpasar in Bali in 1993. 
				The Kalinga Bali Jatra was an effort to recreate and revive the legacy of the historical and cultural links of the two regions which was connected by maritime trade.
				<hr><br><br>
				Holding the fame since more than a thousand years, Cuttack is called as ‘Millenium City’ as well as ‘Silver City’ for this famous silver filigree work. 
				The story begins when it was historically known as ‘Katak’ which means military cantonment, also capital city. Inscriptions derived from the reign of Angabhimadeva
				III of Ganga dynasty say that Cuttack was originally known as ‘Abhinab-Baranasi–Katak’ as the city was situated amidst the rivers– Mahandi and Kathajodi like 
				Varanasi (Baranasi). The all-round significance of Cuttack grew post 8th Century AD. In 10th Century AD, Cuttack became the capital city of the state. 
				Being ruled by numerous rulers like Somavamsi dynasty, Eastern Ganga dynasty, the Gajapati Empire of Suryavamsa dynasty, the Afghans, the Mughals, Marathas,
				and Britishers Cuttack flourished as a centre for trade and commerce, politics and rich cultural and historical heritage. Infact, the famous Barabati Fort was 
				built during the reign of Angabhimadeva III. From Durga Puja to Baliyatra, from Barabati to filigree, Cuttack is termed as one such epicentres of glorious 
				cultural significance. ‘Baliyatra’ or ‘Balijatra’ is the illustrious event that commemorates the ancient maritime trade links and commercial-cultural 
				prominence of Odia traders called ‘Sadhabas’. On the river bank of Mahandi, womenfolk perform ‘Boita Bandana’ on the early morning hours of Kartika Purnima 
				in observance of beginning of the voyage of Odia traders to the Southeast Asian countries. The week-long fair-fest takes place near Barabati Palace where 
				numerous traders, businessmen participate by putting up commercial stalls of various goods.
